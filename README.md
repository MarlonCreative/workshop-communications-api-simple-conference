### Build a simple conference application with Dolby.io, Cloudinary and Netlify.

This app demonstrates a simple video conference, participants list with avatars, mic and video controls, screensharing and recording with Dolby.io Communications APIs. Avatars in this demo are hosted and transformed with Cloudinary, and the GitHub auto-deployment workflow is managed on Netlify.  

> **Note**: 
> To run this example; You will be required to setup a token
> server.

We've created a serverless function to satisfy that requirement. This token server example is targeted for deployment with Netlify Functions. The primary function may adapted for other function as a service on other platforms.  Using a token for [initialization](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/initializing-javascript) of our SDK follows our best practice for securing your application.

Follow the instructions at this [repo](https://github.com/dolbyio-samples/communications-api-token-server-netlify) or simply continue reading below to clone and deploy this token server example. Configuration of the serverless token server example should take just a few minutes.

### Part 1 - Token Server Deployment:
#### How to Install and deploy this project on Netlify:
- First you'll need an API key and API secret to comunicate with the Dobly APIs. To create those:

- Select the **SIGN IN** link located in the upper right corner of the [Dolby.io](https://dolby.io/signup/?&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=cascadiajs2021&utm_source=livestorm) page.

- Log in using your email and password. Click the **DASHBOARD** link visible in the upper right corner of the website.

- Create a new application or select an existing application from the **APPLICATIONS** category located on the left side menu.

- Select the **API Keys** category from the drop-down menu visible under your application.

- In the Communications APIs section, you can access your **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.

####  Now that you have your API credentials, you can clone this example project and deploy it to the web using Netlify.
 
Deploy Your Token Server: 

 [![Deploy To Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/dolbyio-samples/communications-api-token-server-netlify) 
- Clicking the deploy button above will set this all up for you, taking you to your new project admin in Netlify

- Netlify will ask you for a name for the new repository it will create for you, and for you to provide the **CONSUMER_KEY** and **CONSUMER_SECRET** you created to authenticate with Dolby, which it will store as environment variables.

- Once it has deployed, you'll find your project's URL at the top of the site overview page in your Netlify admin, and you'll be able to visit it and navigate to your site's token generator function.  

In addition you'll see a link to your GitHub Repo where your new server resides so you can clone that repo and work on it locally:
 
#### Local installation:

if you want to edit or modify your project just pull down your copy from your GitHub (or GitLab).

```
git clone <your name or repo organization> /communications-api-token-server-netlify
```

```
cd communications-api-token-server-netlify
```

```
npm install
```

>Note: Pushing changes to your repository will autromatically trigger a fresh deployment in Netlify.


### Part 2 -  Simple Video Conference app
#### Lets get this app up and running:
Simple Video Conference App:

[![Deploy To Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/dolbyio-samples/workshop-communications-api-simple-conference)

- Clone and deploy this Simple Video Conference App by clicking the deploy button above; This will set this all up for you, taking you to your new project admin in Netlify.
    
-   Netlify will ask you to authenticate with GitHub; then clone this repo to your GitHub ORG/ Account and setup automatic deployment to a Netlify server environment. 
-   Once it has deployed, you’ll find your project’s URL at the top of the site overview page in your Netlify admin, and you’ll be able to visit it and navigate to the Simple Video Conference app.

>**Note**: At first run the app will fail to work; We need to change the tokenServerURL to point to the url of your token server you created in the first part.

- You can clone your repo locally*  or simply click on the GitHub Link in the Netlify Admin console under the current deployment, this will bring you to your repo; There you can navigate to the www folder and edit the client.js file.
- On Line 16: replace the value with your own token server URL.
```
const tokenServerURL = 'Enter the url to your token server here';
```

Replace 'Enter the url to your token server here' with your url you've copied from the browser window. 

-  Save and push the change and Netlify will automatically pull and deploy a the new, working versions of our Simple Conference app version. 


*Clone the repo and work on it locally:
```
git clone <your name or repo organization> /workshop-communications-api-simple-conference
```

```
cd workshop-communications-api-simple-conference
```
